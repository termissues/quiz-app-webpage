## About
Quiz app with 5 questions about programming. Users can earn up to 50 points, every time user correctly answers a question he gets +10 points.

## Main idea
The main idea was to make a project and try something new with API fetching.
So I figured out why not to try and make a quiz app + add API fetching to it.

## Coming soon features
- [ ] \(Highscores) Planning on displaying high scores.
- [ ] \(API) Make app to be able to fetch questuins from API.
